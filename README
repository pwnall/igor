= seven

Course homework submission website.


== Installation

Follow the standard steps for setting up a Rails development environment.
    git clone
    bundle install
    rake db:create db:migrate

The command below runs the development server. Ctrl+C stops it.
    rails s

The first user registered on the system automatically receives administrative
privileges. Course specifics can be configured by selecting Setup > Course in
the left-side menu.


== Development

Much of the CSS running this site is at https://github.com/pwnall/pwnstyles.
If you want to change it, clone the repository in a sibling directory to seven,
and bundler will find the clone and use it. Refreshing the page should reflect
any CSS changes that you make. If that doesn't happen, touch
app/assets/stylesheets/pwnstyles_main.css.scss

Seed the database to get a reasonably large data set that covers the most used
cases.
    rake db:seed
