<h3>Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,</h3>

<p>
You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) claimed you
have lost your
<%= link_to 'alg.csail.mit.edu', 'http://alg.csail.mit.edu'%>
login name or password.
</p>

<p>
Your login name is listed below:
</p>
<h2>
<%= @token.user.name %>
</h2>

<p>
Please go
<%= link_to 'here', @token_url %>
to the address below to reset your password.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't requested help recovering your
<%= link_to 'alg.csail.mit.edu', 'http://alg.csail.mit.edu'%>
login name or password, you
don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone
mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
<%= link_to '6.006-tas@mit.edu', 'mailto:6.006-tas@mit.edu' %>, and we'll address the problem.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in 6.006!
