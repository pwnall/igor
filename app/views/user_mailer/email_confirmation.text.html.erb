<h3>Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,</h3>

<p>
You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) registered on
<%= link_to 'alg.csail.mit.edu', 'http://alg.csail.mit.edu'%>
claiming to have your e-mail address.
</p>

<p>
Please make sure that you have indeed registered with the login name below:
</p>
<h2><%= @token.user.name %></h2>

<p>
If this is true, you can go
<%= link_to 'here', @token_url %>
to confirm that you own this e-mail address.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't registered to <%= link_to 'alg.csail.mit.edu', 'http://alg.csail.mit.edu'%>,
or the login name above does
not belong to you, you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone
mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
<%= link_to '6.006-tas@mit.edu', 'mailto:6.006-tas@mit.edu' %>, and we'll address the problem.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to 6.006!
