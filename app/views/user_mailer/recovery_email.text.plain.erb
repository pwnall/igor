Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,


You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) claimed you
have lost your alg.csail.mit.edu login name or password.

Your login name is listed below:
<%= @token.user.name %>

Please go to the address below to reset your password.
<%= @token_url %>

If you haven't requested help recovering your alg.csail.mit.edu login name
or password, you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone
mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
6.006-tas@mit.edu, and we'll address the problem.

Thank you for your interest in 6.006!
