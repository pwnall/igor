Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,

You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) registered on
alg.csail.mit.edu claiming to have your e-mail address.

Please make sure that you have indeed registered with the login name below:
<%= @token.user.name %>

If this is true, you can go to the address below to confirm that you own
this e-mail address.
<%= @token_url %>

If you haven't registered to alg.csail.mit.edu, or the login name above does
not belong to you, you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone
mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
6.006-tas@mit.edu, and we'll address the problem.

Welcome to 6.006!
