Dear <%= @token.user.name %>,


You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) claimed you
have lost your <%= @course.number %> server (<%= @root_url %>) password.

Please go to the address below to reset your password.
<%= @token_url %>

If you haven't requested help recovering your <%= @course.number %> password,
you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone mistyped their e-mail. If
you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail <%= @course.email %>, and we'll
address the problem.

Thank you for your interest in <%= @course.number %>!
