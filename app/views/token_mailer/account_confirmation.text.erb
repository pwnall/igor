Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,

You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) registered on
the <%= @course.number %> server (<%= @root_url %>) claiming to have your e-mail
address.

Please make sure that you have indeed registered with the login name below:
<%= @token.user.name %>

If this is true, you can go to the address below to confirm that you own
this e-mail address.
<%= @token_url %>

If you haven't registered on the <%= @course.number %> server, or the login name 
above does not belong to you, you don't need to do anything. Most probably,
someone mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
<%= @course.email %>, and we'll address the problem.

Welcome to <%= @course.number %>!
