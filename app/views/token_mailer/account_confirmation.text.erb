Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,

You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) registered on
the <%= @course.number %> server at <%= @root_url %> claiming to have your
e-mail address.

If this is true, you can go to the address below to confirm that you own
this e-mail address.
<%= @token_url %>

If you haven't registered on the <%= @course.number %> server, you don't need to
do anything. Most probably, someone mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many
e-mails like this, e-mail <%= @course.email %> and we'll address the problem.

Welcome to <%= @course.number %>!
