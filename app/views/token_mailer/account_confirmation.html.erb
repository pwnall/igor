<h3>Dear <%= @token.user.real_name %>,</h3>

<p>
You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) registered on
<%= link_to "the #{@course.number} server", @root_url %>
claiming to have your e-mail address.
</p>

<p>
If this is true, you can go
<%= link_to 'here', @token_url %>
to confirm that you own this e-mail address.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't registered on
<%= link_to "the #{@course.number} server", @root_url %>,
you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone mistyped their e-mail. If
you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
<%= link_to @course.email, "mailto:#{@course.email}" %>
and we'll address the problem.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to <%= @course.number %>!
</p>
