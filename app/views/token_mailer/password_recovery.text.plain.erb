Dear <%= @token.user.email%>,


You are receiving this e-mail because someone (hopefully you) claimed you
have lost your <%= @course.number %> server
(<%= root_url :only_path => false %>) login name or password.

Your login name is listed below:
<%= @token.user.name %>

Please go to the address below to reset your password.
<%= spend_token_url :token => @token.token, :only_path => false %>

If you haven't requested help recovering your <%= @course.number %> server login
name or password, you don't need to do anything. Most probably, someone
mistyped their e-mail. If you receive many e-mails like this, e-mail
<%= @course.number %>-tas@mit.edu, and we'll address the problem.

Thank you for your interest in <%= @course.number %>!
